*SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE, MERGE, ~~JOIN~~, UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT, MINUS, ~~GROUP BY~~, ~~HAVING~~, ORDER BY, CONNECT BY*

## JOIN
- PK and FK exist for join, but join don't requires them
- Multi-Join
```sql
SELECT FIRST_NAME || LAST_NAME AS FULL_NAME, DEPARTMENT_NAME,  CITY, COUNTRY_NAME, REGION_NAME
FROM HR.EMPLOYEES emp JOIN HR.DEPARTMENTS dp ON emp.DEPARTMENT_ID = dp.DEPARTMENT_ID
JOIN HR.LOCATIONS lc ON dp.LOCATION_ID = lc.LOCATION_ID
JOIN HR.COUNTRIES ct ON lc.COUNTRY_ID = ct.COUNTRY_ID
JOIN HR.REGIONS rg ON ct.REGION_ID = rg.REGION_ID;
```

- LEFT/RIGHT/FULL (OUTER) JOIN
```sql
SELECT COUNTRY_NAME, REGION_NAME
FROM HR.COUNTRIES ct 
LEFT JOIN HR.REGIONS rg ON ct.REGION_ID = rg.REGION_ID;

SELECT COUNTRY_NAME, REGION_NAME
FROM HR.REGIONS  ct 
RIGHT JOIN HR.COUNTRIES rg ON ct.REGION_ID = rg.REGION_ID;

SELECT REGION_NAME, COUNTRY_NAME
FROM HR.REGIONS  ct 
LEFT JOIN HR.COUNTRIES rg ON ct.REGION_ID = rg.REGION_ID;

SELECT REGION_NAME, COUNTRY_NAME
FROM HR.COUNTRIES   ct 
RIGHT JOIN HR.REGIONS rg ON ct.REGION_ID = rg.REGION_ID;

SELECT FIRST_NAME || LAST_NAME AS FULL_NAME, JOB_TITLE
FROM HR.EMPLOYEES emp
FULL JOIN HR.JOBS jb ON emp.JOB_ID = jb.JOB_ID;
```
- NATURAL JOIN: only INNER JOIN, forbid table prefix
```sql
SELECT FIRST_NAME || LAST_NAME AS FULL_NAME, JOB_TITLE
FROM HR.EMPLOYEES NATURAL JOIN HR.JOBS;
```
- USING: allow both INNER and OUTER JOIN, forbid table prefix
```sql
SELECT a.FIRST_NAME || a.LAST_NAME AS EMP_NAME, b.FIRST_NAME || b.LAST_NAME AS MNG_NAME
FROM HR.EMPLOYEES a LEFT JOIN HR.EMPLOYEES b
USING (MANAGER_ID);
```
- Non-Equijoin
```sql
CREATE TABLE SALARY_LEVEL 
(
LEVEL_ID NUMBER ,
LEVEL_VAl VARCHAR2(5),
SALARY_MIN NUMBER,
SALARY_MAX NUMBER
);

INSERT INTO SALARY_LEVEL
VALUES (1, 'Low', 0, 6000);

INSERT INTO SALARY_LEVEL
VALUES (2, 'Med', 6001, 10000);

INSERT INTO SALARY_LEVEL
VALUES (3, 'High', 10000, 100000);

SELECT FIRST_NAME || LAST_NAME AS EMP_NAME, LEVEL_VAL
FROM HR.EMPLOYEES JOIN SALARY_LEVEL
ON SALARY BETWEEN SALARY_MIN AND SALARY_MAX;
```

## GROUP BY
- within SELECT creating 'mini-select' statement
- only allow 1. expression specified in GROUP BY; 2. Aggregate function in select list
- ORDER BY restricted to use only: 1. exp in GROUP BY; 2. exp in select list(pos, nam, alias); 3. any Agg func; 4. USER/SYSDATE/UID
- **Two levels deep** is the furthest you can go with nested aggregate functions. no restriction for scalar
```sql
SELECT JOB_ID, ROUND (AVG(SALARY), 2), MAX(SALARY), MIN(SALARY)
FROM HR.EMPLOYEES
GROUP BY JOB_ID
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
## HAVING
- must together with GROUP BY, either order
- only compare exp in GROUP BY or Agg func
```
SELECT JOB_ID, ROUND (AVG(SALARY), 2), MAX(SALARY), MIN(SALARY)
FROM HR.EMPLOYEES
GROUP BY JOB_ID
HAVING MIN(SALARY) > 5000
--HAVING JOB_ID NOT IN ('AD_PRES', 'AD_VP')
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
